   <h1>Artificial Intelligence
</h1>

<p>
<h2> How AI Functions</h2>
- Data Processing: AI uses vast amounts of data to learn and identify patterns.
- Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that allows systems to learn and improve from experience.
- Neural Networks: Modeled after the human brain, neural networks help AI in recognizing patterns and making predictions.
- Deep Learning: A more advanced form of neural networks used for complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing (NLP).

<h3>Introduction to AI</h3>
<p>AI refers to machines or systems that mimic human intelligence.
    It enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human thinking, such as:
      Problem-solving
      Decision-making
     Learning and adaptation
    AI is used in various fields, including healthcare, finance, entertainment, and education.

    <h3>Different Types of AI
    </h3>
    <p>- Narrow AI: Specialized in performing a single task (e.g., voice assistants like Siri).
        - General AI: AI that can understand and perform any intellectual task that a human can (still theoretical).
        - Superintelligent AI: AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects (also hypothetical for now).

        <h3>What is ChatGPT?
        </h3>
        <p>- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of AI language model developed by OpenAI.
            - ChatGPT is an application of GPT, designed to understand and generate human-like text.
            - Itâ€™s trained on large datasets of text from the internet and can answer questions, generate content, assist with writing, and more.

        <h3>The Science Behind ChatGPT
        </h3>
        <Ol>
            <li> Natural Language Processing (NLP): ChatGPT uses NLP to understand human language and generate meaningful responses.</li>
            <li>Transformer Architecture: GPT uses a transformer model, allowing it to understand the context of words in relation to one another.</li>
            <li>Pre-training & Fine-tuning: The model is pre-trained on a vast corpus of data and fine-tuned to generate human-like responses.</li>
